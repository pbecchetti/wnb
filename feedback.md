# Feedback

Thank you for taking the test, we are very happy that you dedicate some time for Wenabi ðŸ’›.

**_How many hours did you work on this mini project ?_**

Between 4 and 5 hours I believe

## You have something else to say ?

Before submitting your final work, tell us what you think about these different topics:

**Note**: It is totally **OK** for you to not have any feedback. We simply wanted to give a space for anyone who feels that this process can be improved and we are happy to hear it. Also, there are no right/wrong answers !

**_1 - How do you feel about the workload that was necessary to complete the mini project ? Would you say it was too much or too little ?_**

It might be a bit too much considering it would take at least 2 evenings to do it if we're already employed. Maybe it would be nice to get rid of 2 or 3 specs and make them optionals.

**_2 - How would you change this exam and/or examination process?_**

I think it's better than a live coding exercise, so you have time to think ahead of the structure, and it's a real life project, much related to what a developer does in a daily basis, compared to abstract mathematical algorithms.
